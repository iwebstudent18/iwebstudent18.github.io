                <h3>Week 4</h3>
                <div class="date">7/5/2019</div>
                <p>This is my fourth week of Web desiging in Iolani Summer School.
                    This week I did some updates on this website and I was designign my XD website a
                    little bit more The updates I did on my website was I changed the font of all the
                    pages, I fixed a little bug/ a little problem on my Blog page, I caught up with all
                    of my blogs I needed to type/write, and I changed the color of the header.
                    Also in XD I linked/connected my main page and my sub pages in my XD and I
                    coustimized the header so it has all different colors and a nice picture I photo
                    shopped myself. I am excited for week 5 and what the future holds for this class.

                <h3>Week 3</h3>
                <div class="date">6/28/2019</div>
                <p>On my third week of Web Design I was starting to learn about XD/photo shopping.
                    Also I coustimized my website more so it it looks nice and presentable.
                    XD is basically a website where you can make a prototype adn just coustimize it
                    and design it. Also, in photo shop I learned how to take a picture from Lorem
                    Picsum and transport it into Photo shop and change the filter and how to mark
                    the picture up too. That is what I did in week 3!
